**Abstract:**
This project aims to address the impact of climate change on nutritional inequalities globally. Previous research has shown a linear increase in atmospheric temperature over the past twenty-three years, attributed largely to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. This increase in temperature has led to soil degradation and decreased soil fertility, impacting the growth of essential food crops. Additionally, shifts in regional temperatures and weather patterns have been observed, affecting geographic ranges and altering the timing of plant blooming. The combination of these factors poses a significant challenge to food security, particularly in terms of growing nutritional food crops.

In the first phase of our analysis, we focused on staple crops such as potatoes, maize, soybeans, and wheat, aiming to ensure adequate caloric intake for populations. Building on this foundation, the second phase of our research will place a greater emphasis on crops that provide essential micro and macro nutrients. Specifically, we will evaluate the yield of Cassava, Sweet Potatoes, Sorghum, Rice, and Plantains, considering their potential to address nutritional deficiencies across different populations.

Utilizing statistical analysis, we will determine the optimal regions for growing each crop, considering factors such as climate suitability, soil conditions, and geographic distribution. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the reduction of nutritional inequalities exacerbated by climate change.
